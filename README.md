Andropause, often referred to as "male menopause," is a natural, age-related hormonal change that occurs in men. It is characterized by a gradual decline in testosterone levels, which is the primary male sex hormone produced in the testes. Unlike menopause in women, which involves a sharp decline in estrogen and the cessation of menstruation, andropause is a more gradual process.
As testosterone levels decrease, men may experience a range of physical and emotional changes. These can include a decrease in sexual desire (libido), difficulties achieving or maintaining erections, reduced muscle mass and strength, an increase in body fat (particularly around the abdomen), fatigue, mood swings, irritability, and difficulty concentrating. Additionally, andropause can lead to decreased bone density, potentially increasing the risk of osteoporosis.
